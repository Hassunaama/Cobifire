# Cobifire

## What is it??

Cobifire (previously FabiCore) is an essential QOL and addon plugin for Paper and Velocity servers! It adds moderation, hub functionality, maintenance, LuckPerms and Placeholder API support, extended proxy settings  and more all without compromising customizability and full control of all the features! It also makes server setup super easy, and has an great cozy design.

## What is the "addon" thing you talked about?

Cobifire has an fixed server reload and plugin management system for maximum workability and connectivity between plugins and even client mods!

## Ok sounds great! But it also sounds like a very long and hard process to setup..

For just installed new servers, Cobifire is SUPER easy to setup and install. And it can also setup your whole server in almost an instant!

For already existing servers, the Cobifire wizard works as well! It automatically detects all your plugins and server configuration, and tries to combine them to the "Cobifire Framework System"!

## Perfect! How can I download it, and for what server systems?

You can download it our [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/cobifire) for Paper and Velocity! (NOTE! Cobifire is still in an public ALPHA so it might have a LOT of bugs!) If you have an Velocity proxy server, install the plugin on your Velocity server AND your Paper servers! If you have an independent Paper server, install it to it.
